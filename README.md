# Music-Tonal

It is a framework to process tonal music.
The core library is written in C, based on the [2016 Martin Aberg's work](https://github.com/endofexclusive/tonal).
The original library was modified to fit better the integration with other languages, creating clean interfaces using only trivial data types.

## Purposes

- This work is made for my own fun and to review musical theory under algorithmic thoughts.
- Create a Perl module integrating the C lib.
- Create hooks to integrate the library in other music software like MuseScore.

## How it was made

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. 

Using the Agile methodology and documenting each step for future research. 

* Each scrum must have tasks covering the 7 Stages of DevOps.

> 1. Plan
> 1. Create
> 1. Verify
> 1. Pre-prod
> 1. Release
> 1. Configure
> 1. Monitor 

* For each task create an issue with a requirement description in the form: "==USER== _does_ TASK so ==PERSON== _gets_ RESULT". 

Using this pattern we can understand ==who== needs to do *==what==* to get ==something== and for ==whom==.


```sequence
Who->Whom: Do what
Note left of Whom: Get stuff
```

_How do it_ is a deal to be solved on next steps.


> ### Example
> #### _Create Something Else_

> "==John Doe== _does_ something so ==Richard Roe== _gets_ something else"
